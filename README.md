# Bina Word Counter Tests

This program counts the number of words within a file

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following files and folders in your workspace to ensure all tests run and pass succesfully
* foreignText.txt
* Numerics.txt
* punctuationOnly.txt
* russianText.txt
* punctuationWords.txt
* foreignText.txt
* Seven_Words.txt
* Zero_Words.txt
* DifferentDirectory.txt
* DifferentDirectory\ (Folder)


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
C:\Users\Conor\workspace\Bina_Test\foreignText.txt
```

I can only test the directories for windows 

```
C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\workspace\Bina_Test\foreignText.txt
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
