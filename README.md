# Bina Word Counter Tests

This program counts the number of words within a file

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following files and folders in your workspace to ensure all tests run and pass succesfully
* foreignText.txt
* Numerics.txt
* punctuationOnly.txt
* russianText.txt
* punctuationWords.txt
* foreignText.txt
* Seven_Words.txt
* Zero_Words.txt
* DifferentDirectory.txt
* DifferentDirectory\ DifferentDirectory.txt


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Your workspace should contain the project ``` Bina_Test```  like mine below

```
C:\Users\Conor\workspace\Bina_Test
```

I can only test the directories for windows 

```
C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\workspace\Bina_Test
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the ```  TestSuite  ``` and all 14 tests should run and pass
You can also see the program running in the main, by running the method ``` demoCount(); ```

### Break down into end to end tests
