# Bina Word Counter Tests

This program counts the number of words within a file

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following files and folders in your workspace to ensure all tests run and pass succesfully
* foreignText.txt
* Numerics.txt
* punctuationOnly.txt
* punctuationWords.txt
* foreignText.txt
* Seven_Words.txt
* Zero_Words.txt
* DifferentDirectory.txt
* DifferentDirectory\ 


```
Give examples
```

### Installing

Your workspace should contain the project ``` Bina_Test```  like mine below

```
C:\Users\Conor\workspace\Bina_Test
```

I can only test the directories for windows 

```
C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\workspace\Bina_Test
```



## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the ```  TestSuite  ``` and all 14 tests should run and pass
You can also see the program running in the main, by running the method ``` demoCount(); ```

## Why you tested your word counter the way you did?
To test the  ``` WordCounter  ``` class I need a unit test that can test each of its public methods to ensure all the all the code works as it is intended to work. With my approach, I wrote the automated  tests as I wrote the program, as opposed to writing the tests after developing the program. This helped me define the acceptance criteria and allowed me to focus on the flow of the program.

My workflow was as follows:
* Add a test
* Run all tests and see if the new one fails
* Write some code
* Run tests
* Refactor code
* Repeat

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that tes

## Why you think your testing is sufficient for your code to be merged?
To run the tests, run the ```  TestSuite  ``` and all 14 tests should run and pass
You can also see the program running in the main, by running the method ``` demoCount(); ```

## Comment on additional testing you would consider beyond this JUnit test suite after your code is merged
To run the tests, run the ```  TestSuite  ``` and all 14 tests should run and pass
You can also see the program running in the main, by running the method ``` demoCount(); ```

## Include the time you spent on the entire exercise 
* 9-10 Hours(this includes research and planning)

## Built With

* Core JDK
* Eclipse
* Sublime Text 3
